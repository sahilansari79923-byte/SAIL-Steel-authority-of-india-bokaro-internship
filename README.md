## Project Details


#### Project Focus: Study of latest implementations in Coke Quenching and Horizontal Coke Oven Charging (Horizontal Loading) at SAIL BSL.

* Coke Quenching Systems:
Explored modern coke quenching practices aimed at controlling coke temperature, improving coke strength and stability, optimizing moisture content, and reducing dust and thermal losses.
Understood the role of advanced quenching methods in improving environmental performance and operational safety in coke-making plants.

* Horizontal Coke Oven Charging:
Studied horizontal coal charging mechanisms used in coke ovens to ensure uniform coal distribution across the oven chamber.
Analyzed how horizontal loading helps in achieving consistent coke quality, reducing charging losses, and minimizing fugitive emissions.

* Process & Operations:
Observed process flow from coal charging to coke discharge and quenching, focusing on technological improvements and best operational practices.

* Learning Outcome:
Developed practical insights into industrial coke-making operations, modern process control approaches, and technology-driven efficiency improvements in integrated steel plants.
